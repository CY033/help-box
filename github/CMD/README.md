### 1. **Check the branch name**
   Run the following command to check if you're on the correct branch:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
   This will list all local branches and mark the current branch with an asterisk (`*`). Make sure that the branch you're trying to push is named `Sih-2024` or the correct name if it's different.

### 2. **Create the branch (if it doesn't exist)**
   If the branch `Sih-2024` doesn't exist, you can create it:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b Sih-2024
   ```
   This will create a new branch called `Sih-2024` and switch to it.

### 3. **Push the branch to the remote**
   Now that you're on the correct branch, try pushing it to the remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin Sih-2024
   ```
   The `-u` option sets the upstream tracking branch, meaning future `git push` commands will default to pushing this branch to the same remote branch.

### 4. **Check if the branch already exists on the remote**
   If the branch already exists on the remote with a different name, you can use:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git branch -r
   ```
   This will show you a list of all remote branches.

After following these steps, the issue should be resolved. If not, let me know what other errors or details you're seeing!
